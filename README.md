# City Centre Front

This is a web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that interacts with a backend API. The application provides a user interface for interacting with the API and displaying data to the user.

## Installation

To get started with the application, you will need to install the dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code

`npm install`

This will install all the necessary packages for the application to run.

## Configuration

The application requires a `.env` file to be set up with the endpoint of the backend API. To set up the `.env` file, create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the application and add the following line:

`CITYCENTRE_URL=<<BACKEND_API_ENDPOINT>> `

Replace `<<BACKEND_API_ENDPOINT>>` with the endpoint of the backend API.

## Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

`npm run dev`

This will start the application in development mode. You can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Building the Application

To build the application for production, run the following command:

Copy code

`npm run build`

This will create a production-ready version of the application in the `./out` directory.

## Conclusion

This concludes the setup guide for the Next.js application. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please refer to the official [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) or open an issue in the GitHub repository.
